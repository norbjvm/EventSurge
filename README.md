  <h1>EventSurge</h1>
  <p>A powerful, flexible, and modern event management plugin for Minecraft servers</p>
</div>

---
Hereâ€™s an updated **README.md** draft for EventSurge v2.1.0, reflecting all the new features, fixes, and improvementsâ€”including auto-extracted events, multi-language support, and more.  
---

## ðŸš€ What's New in 2.1.0
- **Double Progress FIXED** â€“ No more double progress bugs for global or per-player events; event listeners are guaranteed to be registered only once.
- **Global/Community Event Sync** â€“ Global event progress is truly collective and rewards are only given to contributors.
- **Full Multi-Language Support** â€“ All plugin messages (events, help, commands, etc.) are now fully translatable, including the `/eventsurge lang <lang>` command.
- **Built-in Language Files** â€“ Comes with English, Spanish, Indonesian, French, and German language files out of the box!
- **Dynamic Help & Command Messages** â€“ Help/command messages are loaded from language files and displayed in the selected language.
- **Modern GUI Layout** â€“ The event GUI now shows only 3 main categories in the center, with sub-GUIs for each category.
- **More Example Events** â€“ Many new example global and community events (mining, killing, fishing, crafting, placing, custom) included in `events.yml`, ready to use.
- **Debug Mode Toggle** â€“ Debug logging can now be enabled/disabled via `config.yml` (`debug: true/false`).
- **Placeholder & Reload Improvements** â€“ All message placeholders are consistent, and config/language reloads are truly runtime.
- **Event Without Reward** â€“ Events without rewards are now loaded (with a warning), not skipped.
- **Improved Listener Management** â€“ Event listeners are registered/unregistered correctly, preventing duplicate handlers.
